    "Both betweenness centrality calculations (shortest and fastest) using the networkx package seem reasonable. The main traffic axes of Heidelberg are linked to the highest centrality values. The main difference between the two graphs are the centrality values themselves. For the fastest routes the range of centrality values is wider than for the shortest routes. This makes sense because the main traffic axes are usually the fastest roads and are therefore used more often when taking the fastest route rather than the shortest. It is also noticeable that the roads and routes on the outskirts of the city become less important when choosing the fastest route. The centrality values are more spread out when looking at the results of the shortest route, as more routes are considered.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the number of routes increases, the geographically adjusted betweenness centrality develops a similar pattern to the networkx calculation. The major difference is that it emphasizes the main traffic axes even more and is therefore even more plausible. It also highlights other main routes that may not be the fastest, but are frequently used in practice, such as the roads up the KÃ¶nigstuhl.\n",

    "Another difference is the range of centrality values. The networkx centrality values seem to be normalized where the geographical approach has absolute values. But this difference does not change the results in the graphs where the geographical approach gives good results."

    "Both centrality indices differ in the spatial extent and in the absolute values.\n",
    "With a route count (n) of 50, the centrality index, which is based on population data, focuses primarily on graphs in the populous city center. The completely random geographical approach shows a broader spatial extent at n=50, covering the entire city area. With an increase to n=100, the difference in the absolute centrality values becomes clearer. As the approach based on population distribution focuses on the city center, e.g. Old Bridge, significantly higher values are calculated in this area. The methodology should certainly be questioned or adapted so that 2 points in the city center are not so often used for the centrality calculation. This represents an exciting further development to implement this weighting even more meaningfully. The random approach shows a broader picture with smaller values, but strongly emphasizes graphs that cover a relatively large amount of space (due to the nearest node approach).  "
